To determine most suitable distribution for model development.

## 1. exploratory data analysis
```{r}
# Assuming 'growth_index' is response variable
library(ggplot2)

# Histogram
ggplot(data, aes(x = growth_index)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) + 
  theme_minimal()

# Q-Q Plot
qqnorm(data$growth_index)
qqline(data$growth_index)

# Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(data$growth_index)

# Skewness and Kurtosis
library(moments)
skewness(data$growth_index)
kurtosis(data$growth_index)
```
Histogram: Plot a histogram of the response variable (growth_index). This can give a visual idea of the distribution.
Q-Q Plot: Create a quantile-quantile plot to compare your data against a theoretical normal distribution.
Skewness and Kurtosis: Calculate these metrics to quantify the shape of the distribution.
Shapiro-Wilk test: tests the null hypothesis that a sample came from a normally distributed population.

## distribution strategy
Run exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, and consider alternative distributions if data isn't normally distributed. 

Poisson: For count data
Binomial: For proportion data
Gamma: For continuous, positive, right-skewed data
Beta: For continuous data bounded between 0 and 1
Log-normal: For right-skewed continuous data

Can try a transformation to make data more normal-like:
Log transformation: For right-skewed data
Square root transformation: For count data
Box-Cox transformation: A family of power transformations

Model comparison: fit models with different distributions and compare them using criteria like AIC, BIC, or WAIC. 

To implement changes in distribution into a JAGS model, change the distribution main loop in the comprehensive_model.txt file and adjust have mean (mu) is calculated based on chosen distribution.
For Poisson: y[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])
For Gamma: y[i] ~ dgamma(shape, rate[i])
For Beta: y[i] ~ dbeta(alpha[i], beta[i])
